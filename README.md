### 2020 11 27 : 1210 || Readme
Reorganized all readme entries.  I placed everything in a Scrivener document.  The idea is to write here, in a wordprocessing application.  It will help me check my spelling.  It will also provide a backup for all work.  Finally, when the day is over and I’m uploading into GH, I will have everything I did through the day written here…I only need to copy and paste.  
Another thing I wanted to do before the Readme files became overwhelmingly large.  I wanted the file to read backwards.  You should read what is recent at the beginning of the document.  If you want to follow what came before, scroll and it should be easy to see.  Finally, I created lines to break apart days.  Sometimes you will have titles, subtitles with the day, and sub-sub titles with the time.  These needed to be “blocked” in a manner that is less confusing than continuing to look to see what day you are on.

This weeks lesson was on the subject of adding exceptions into your code to keep errors from crashing your code.  Today I'm adding two exceptions.  1) Keep the user from inputing somthing other than a number, and 2) Keep the user from inputing a number that is lower than -100 and greater than 100.  This will be fun!!

Completed assignment with so much exp.  I really think this was an amazing EXP assignment that I want to diver further in the subject of exceptions.  Still... Got to move one.
