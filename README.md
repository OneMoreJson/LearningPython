Completed the forums and the responses.

## 2020 12 07 : 0830 || Week 06 Lesson
Focus is on the lessons and working through them in the JNBs.

### 11:21 || Week 06 Lesson
Completed all lessons reviews and wrote everthing in J NB. Might work on the forums for the week.  It would be good to do that and not have to worry about them later.  Also, I could get started on the actually assignment.  BTW, we studied Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries.  I stumbled across sets.  I don’t know if studied these before but it was funny.  I was trying to write a dictionary and placed a comma instead of a colon.  tada, it is a Set.

## 2020 12 04 : 2100 || Week 05 Lesson
Completed assignment.  This was challenging as we had a lot of, well, dumb requirements that mad the work of changing a string to and integer into a string into an integer again just to make sure we could do something for the assignment.  Still, we need to show we know what is going on. I get that.  It was challenging and I enjoyed the task.  I had to work with and outside Jupiter Notebooks.  So, that was interesting.  
BTW, I forgot, but I updated Week05 Assignment to include challenges that were apparently required for the assignment.

## 2020 11 28 : 1330 || Week 05 Lessons
Ran through the weeks lessons on modules and string iteration with Jupiter Notebooks.  That took a lot longer.  Some of the lessons pushed me to use the IDLE.  I still need to work on this.  Finally, I prepared the docs to work on week 05 assignment.  I’m going to work on the assignment tomorrow.

## 2020 11 27 : 1210 || Readme
Reorganized all readme entries.  I placed everything in a Scrivener document.  The idea is to write here, in a wordprocessing application.  It will help me check my spelling.  It will also provide a backup for all work.  Finally, when the day is over and I’m uploading into GH, I will have everything I did through the day written here…I only need to copy and paste.  
Another thing I wanted to do before the Readme files became overwhelmingly large.  I wanted the file to read backwards.  You should read what is recent at the beginning of the document.  If you want to follow what came before, scroll and it should be easy to see.  Finally, I created lines to break apart days.  Sometimes you will have titles, subtitles with the day, and sub-sub titles with the time.  These needed to be “blocked” in a manner that is less confusing than continuing to look to see what day you are on.

## 2020 11 25 : 1430 || Week 04 Assignment
This weeks lesson was on the subject of adding exceptions into your code to keep errors from crashing your code.  Today I'm adding two exceptions.  1) Keep the user from inputing somthing other than a number, and 2) Keep the user from inputing a number that is lower than -100 and greater than 100.  This will be fun!!

### 2120 || Week 04 Assignment
Completed assignment with so much exp.  I really think this was an amazing EXP assignment that I want to diver further in the subject of exceptions.  Still... Got to move one.
