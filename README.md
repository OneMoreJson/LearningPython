### 2021 09 04 0800 || Updates

Reworking the folder system on my local drive.  This will reflect how I have done with the “Learning Java” repo.  Instead of keeping the repo specifically tied to a college, LinkedIn Learning or Udemy course, I will combine projects that I think show both my learning progress and potential portfolio projects.  Note, I think I will take “worthy” projects and post them on my own website… things tend to get lost in the GH tangle.  However, I want to show anyone that I am continuing to advance my skills.  GH seems like a great place to demonstrate a working sketchbook of the notes and projects I have done through the years.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 12 27 : 1100 || Week 08 Assignment
Completed assignment and uploaded everything to AMU.  I also created a word doc to explain what I did for testing.  Knowing this instructor, it won’t matter.  He’ll say something was supposed to be done, even though the instructions don’t say anything about what he is wanting completed.  This class was fun, but the instructor sucked. Dr. Bowler.  Remember that name cause, I don’t want to deal with him ever again.  Some students say they are questioning life choices because this guy sucks as an instructor.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 12 26 : 2330 || Week 08 Assignment
Updated the files with new comments for the week.  I also test the work.  Tomorrow, I think I’ll make docs showing how this things works and how much I’ve tested it.  Then, I need to send it up and hope the instructor things he was perfectly clear on his instruction… “I didn’t want a calculator… I wanted a Teddy Ruxspin.” …sigh. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 12 25 : 1500 || Week 08 Assignment
Focus on completing the entire assignment.  Will review Saturday and submit Sunday.

### 2230 || Assignment
I think I’ve done what I can.  It isn’t perfect.  I am kind of proud I got this far.  However, who knows what the instructor wants.  I’m going to send this in and the guy is going to tell me he wanted this or that… According to the requirements, I met every one of those!  …Alright, I’m venting.  This is 95% done.  I’m putting it up for tonight.  I’ll focus on the web dev project tomorrow and then give this a review.  Good for now.  Maybe good enough to ship.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 12 23 : 0800 || Week 08 Lesson
Reviewed the lessons and worked them through VSC.  JN wouldn’t really work for the stuff I needed.  It’s ok though.  It took longer to wrap my head around the fact that you might append a document but you need to write function into that doc.  Other than that, I need to respond to the instructors grading of last week’s assignment.  Finally, I need to complete the Forum for this week.  I should do that today since tomorrow is Christmas Eve and I need to find something else for Miya.  

### 1900 || Week 08 Forum
Completed this week’s forum.  It was a softball, since it didn’t really ask what we learned about this week. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 12 18 : 0630 || Week 07 Assignment
On main code, I deleted the unneeded Vars I used to implement the OBJ.  Figured out last night that I could put in int and str inside the argument (parameter) portion and that would hold until I called the user to provide a number and operator.  There is a lot more I could cut out from the code, but “who knows” what the instructor thinks is necessary.  The instructions say build on your last project.  If I took out everything from last week, does that mean “I didn’t do what was instructed?”  I’ve been burned too many times for thinking I knew what was best.  
Awaiting the instructor’s response to my email before I upload to AMU. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 12 17 : 0830 || Week 07 Assignment
Sandboxing the assignment. Trying to figure out how this stuff can be put into a class and then later called to perform the main calculations.

### 2010 || Week 07 Assignment
Completed with a good checks.  I emailed the instructor to find out if the class needs to be in a new document or if we are expected to leave it in MyLib. Moved the JN within a new doc.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 12 16 : 1900 || Week 07 Forum
Responded to any questions towards the forums.  Also (this is partially blending projects, but…) I am competing OOP focus LI class.  More in the LI Repo.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 12 15 : 2100 || Week 07 Forum 
Completed.  Actually debugged someone else’s code.  It helps to solidify what I know… or realize what works and doesn’t!  I think I’ll pull other Python stuff from GH to check other’s work. It help me learn to be a much better coder.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 12 14 : 2030 || Week 07 Lesson
Spent the day trying to understand classes in Python.  Went through the lessons within JSN.  I’ll upload my JSN when I have completed the week.  I’ll need to ask the instructor what exactly he wants for the assignment.  (He isn’t really good at instructing on the assignments…)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 12 11 : 0800 || Week 06 Assignment
Continue working on the assignment.  I uploaded yesterday’s work, today.  I was too tired and my brain hurt.  I feel like I got far with a lot of spaghetti code.  Some things look like I could fix them and make cleaner.  Other things are broken and have first priority.  

### 1030 || Division Issue
Figured out why the error detection on wasn’t working on one part of the code but on another.  I forgot to “return” the values.  It was a case of “one of these things doesn’t look like another.”  Now that it’s done, I’m going to make sure it meets the assignment requirements.  Then it’s time to ship!!!  On to the next, LOL!

### 1300 || Week 06 Branch
I have it working but I want tot week things to see if I can make it better.  I’m making a “local branch” in another sub folder to try some of those changes.  

### 1430 || Week 06 Revised
Created a branch and “cleaned” up some code.  I like it better this way and I think it still meets the assignment requirements.  I finished and moved the branch into the main folder.  The older I pushed into an archive, “just in case” I’m off the mark on this one.  Finally, I pushed up the work to AMU… It’s in their hands.  I got to move on.  Great artist ship!

### 2030 || Week 06 Second Revision
I couldn’t help but think there were better ways of fixing the code that looked a lot more like the instructor’s examples.  Then I remembered the allInOne function only had two parameters.  That just wasn’t how I did it.  I had three because I was trying to work out what operation would be done, and only that was stored in the AIO list.  Then I realized I was doing this twice.  The AIO should just calculate all the operations and later the print function would ONLY show what the user wanted to have calculated.  This meant my AIO function was reduced a ton. 
Then I, through trial and error, I learned that I could store the function’s list returns in the dictionary without needing to first dedicate another list within the main code.  I.E.  myDict[‘name’] = MyLib.allInOne(numA, numB)[0] placed the value in the list into my dictionary value with the item ‘name’  … That is incredible!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 12 10 : 0830 || Week 06 Assignment
Started the work on the assignment.  Working with the instructions and “sketching” the possibilities using J NB.

### 2100 || Week 06 Assignment
Spent the entire day working on this.  This was not an easy project.  I ripped out a ton of stuff and remade other stuff to meet the requirements.  I’m still having an issue with the division… Funny, it works fine when I select the All function. I’ll have to finish that before I send it.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 12 09 : 1115 || Week 06 Forum
Completed the forums and the responses.  

### 2110 || Week 06 Assignment
Prepared to work on this weeks assignments.  Moved a dup into the Week 06 and updated comments.  Also created a scratch sheet for playing out how I want to accomplish the problem.  
1. I need to create menu using a list
2. I need to create a function that returns results to a dictionary
3. Dictionary is called “allInOne”
4. I need to update my print response to show: “num1 + num2 = result”
5. The final needs to print 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 12 07 : 0830 || Week 06 Lesson
Focus is on the lessons and working through them in the JNBs.

### 11:21 || Week 06 Lesson
Completed all lessons reviews and wrote everthing in J NB. Might work on the forums for the week.  It would be good to do that and not have to worry about them later.  Also, I could get started on the actually assignment.  BTW, we studied Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries.  I stumbled across sets.  I don’t know if studied these before but it was funny.  I was trying to write a dictionary and placed a comma instead of a colon.  tada, it is a Set.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 12 04 : 2100 || Week 05 Lesson
Completed assignment.  This was challenging as we had a lot of, well, dumb requirements that mad the work of changing a string to and integer into a string into an integer again just to make sure we could do something for the assignment.  Still, we need to show we know what is going on. I get that.  It was challenging and I enjoyed the task.  I had to work with and outside Jupiter Notebooks.  So, that was interesting.  
BTW, I forgot, but I updated Week05 Assignment to include challenges that were apparently required for the assignment.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 11 28 : 1330 || Week 05 Lessons
Ran through the weeks lessons on modules and string iteration with Jupiter Notebooks.  That took a lot longer.  Some of the lessons pushed me to use the IDLE.  I still need to work on this.  Finally, I prepared the docs to work on week 05 assignment.  I’m going to work on the assignment tomorrow.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 11 27 : 1210 || Readme
Reorganized all readme entries.  I placed everything in a Scrivener document.  The idea is to write here, in a wordprocessing application.  It will help me check my spelling.  It will also provide a backup for all work.  Finally, when the day is over and I’m uploading into GH, I will have everything I did through the day written here…I only need to copy and paste.  
Another thing I wanted to do before the Readme files became overwhelmingly large.  I wanted the file to read backwards.  You should read what is recent at the beginning of the document.  If you want to follow what came before, scroll and it should be easy to see.  Finally, I created lines to break apart days.  Sometimes you will have titles, subtitles with the day, and sub-sub titles with the time.  These needed to be “blocked” in a manner that is less confusing than continuing to look to see what day you are on.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2020 11 25 : 1430 || Week 04 Assignment
This weeks lesson was on the subject of adding exceptions into your code to keep errors from crashing your code.  Today I'm adding two exceptions.  1) Keep the user from inputing somthing other than a number, and 2) Keep the user from inputing a number that is lower than -100 and greater than 100.  This will be fun!!

### 2120 || Week 04 Assignment
Completed assignment with so much exp.  I really think this was an amazing EXP assignment that I want to diver further in the subject of exceptions.  Still... Got to move one.
