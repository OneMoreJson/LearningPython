You are going to enhance the prior assignment by doing the following:-

1) Create a function for each math operation (add, div, mult, sub)
2) The application will run forever, you will ask the user to continue or not.
3) create a function isInRange to test a value between two ranges like this;
Here is the spec in pseudo code
isInRange(lr, hr, n)
lr=low range
hr=high range
n=number
if n between lr and hr
    return true
else
    return false

Hints
1) For practice please see lab exercises in the lesson section
2) See Sample output for messages
Sample output

Enter your Lower range ---> 10
Enter your Higher range ---> 20
Enter your First number ---> 15
Enter your Second number ---> 17

The Result of 15.0+17.0=32.0
The Result of 15.0-17.0=-2.0
The Result of 15.0*17.0=255.0
The Result of 15.0/17.0=0.882352941176

Continue Looping? (Y/N): Y

Enter your Lower range ---> 20
Enter your Higher range ---> 30
Enter your First number ---> 25
Enter your Second number ---> 50
The input values are out side the input ranges
Please check the numbers and try again

Continue Looping? (Y/N): N
